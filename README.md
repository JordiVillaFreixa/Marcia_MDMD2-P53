# Identification-of-MDM2-P53-Inhibitors-Using-Machine-Learning-Guided-Screening
This Jupyter notebook helps users develop and evaluate machine-learning models for structure-based virtual screening, specifically targeting MDM2 at the p53 binding site. The models are classification-based and can be trained with or without hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
